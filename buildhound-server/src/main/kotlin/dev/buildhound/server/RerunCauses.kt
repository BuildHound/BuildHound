/**
 * Version-tolerant substring classification of one Gradle task's `executionReasons` entry (plan 061,
 * research F11). Gradle's reason strings are human-readable diagnostic output, **not an API contract**
 * (F11's narrowing) — patterns are pinned against real Gradle 9.6.1 message templates rather than
 * guessed: the string constants were verified directly against the `gradle-execution`/`gradle-core`
 * jars from the project's own `9.6.1` wrapper distribution (`InputValueChanges`, `ImplementationChanges`,
 * `PropertyChanges`/`DefaultFileChange`, `NeverUpToDateStep`, `DefaultTaskExecutionMode` — see
 * `RerunCauseClassifierTest` for the exact strings and which are golden-fixture-confirmed vs.
 * template-reconstructed). Matching stays case-insensitive substrings with an explicit fallback so a
 * future Gradle rewording only inflates [RerunCause.UNCLASSIFIED] — it never throws. Cross-bucket
 * collisions (a message that happens to mention more than one bucket's keywords) are resolved
 * deterministically by the fixed check order below, not left to chance; [RerunCauseClassifierTest]'s
 * adversarial near-miss cases pin that order for the ambiguous bucket pairs identified so far. That is
 * the tested claim — not a guarantee that *every* unforeseen wording is misattribution-proof.
 *
 * Match order matters: the more specific buckets (FORCED, CACHING_DISABLED, IMPL_CLASSPATH) are checked
 * before the broader OUTPUT_MISSING / UPSTREAM_OUTPUT / SOURCE catch-alls, so a message that happens to
 * mention more than one bucket's keywords always resolves to the earlier (more-specific) bucket in this
 * order, never the later (more-generic) one it also matches — see [RerunCauseClassifierTest]'s
 * `has changed from` string, which is input-property-shaped yet correctly resolves to IMPL_CLASSPATH.
